## Answers

- Unnecessary repetition of null - can use `Array.from`
- Use of both `function() {}` syntax and `() => {}` syntax
- Use of `if else` branch where `switch` would work.
  - Good exercise in reading documentation for recommended idioms
  - e.g. handling arrow keys - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key
- Rendering in return does not make use of conditional rendering
